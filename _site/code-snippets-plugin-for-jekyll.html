    <p>When I started writing this blog in <a href="https://jekyllrb.com" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, I wanted to keep my code snippets in git and automatically inject them in my posts as needed. Disappointingly, Jekyll didn’t support this feature out of the box. Fortunately, Bryan Roessler <a href="https://blog.bryanroessler.com/2020-03-18-insert-code-blocks-from-repository/" target="_blank">in his blog</a> has an excellent plugin that worked nicely (although I was getting some warnings about the open-uri library). However, I recently updated to a newer version of Ruby and it stopped working altogether. Maybe I was missing a gem or something but in any case I decided that it was a good opportunity to get rid of open-uri. The tweaked code looks like this:</p>

<p>I hear a little voice in my head that says that I should probably sanitize the injected data, but as long as I only inject my own code, it should be ok.</p>
